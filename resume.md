# Experience #

* *PureCars, Frontend Team Lead*
  * Hired to take over as lead engineer for frontend development that was previously led by Director of Development with little frontend technology experience.
  * Updated frontend stack from staticlly served Angular.js applications to modern React and Node.js serverside render application hosted in Azure.
  * Implemented full continous build and release of frontend projects instead of committing minified code to source control.
  * Implemented missing software development practices into frontend team including code reviews, unit/integration testing, dev ops, git flow, code documentation, and build tooling with HMR.
  * Mentored team members on data structures & algorithms, JavaScript architectures, frontend performance, backend architectures, HTTP/REST conventions, and data persistence/caching.
  * Created effective communication for remote team members by developing practices around pull requests, kaban case management, wiki articles, and system notifications.
  * As a result of my efforts, the frontend team ships daily instead of bi-weekly, reduced red alerts from daily to monthly occurrences, higher output of features and bugfixes, and application load times from 30 secs to sub 2 secs.

* *AT&T, Senior Software Engineer*
  * Initally hired as a Flex developer to work on the browser team for [AT&T Messages](https://www.att.com/features/backup-sync.html), a Flex/Java stack. Two weeks in, VPs wanted a pivot to HTML5. More importantly they wanted it to work on the iPad.
  * Got up to speed on the latest HTML5/JS features. Working on a team of three developers shipped a text messaging prototype written in HTML5 in the span of two months. The prototype won the Flex team the new project assignment instead of hiring outside JS developers.
  * Wrote a greenfield text messaging application in Angular 1 base off the prototype. The current application is still running in production after 4 years.
  * Upgraded legacy long polling service in prototype to websockets for higher realtime reliablity.
  * Improved load time using minification, cdns, long caching policies, local storage, application cache, and chunked modules to keep revisit load times around 1 second and initial visits to less than 7 seconds.

* *Eyewonder, Software Engineer*
  * Developed a VAST/VPAID compilant Flex framework to integrate into publisher's video player.
  * Integrated the framework into ABC, CBS, MSN, MTV, Comedy Centeral, and Pandora Radio's video players.
  * Video advertising went from proof of concept to 2nd highest revenue for the company.
