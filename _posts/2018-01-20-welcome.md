Welcome to my person resume site and occasional blog entry that I use to tell the world about things I've
worked and a struggled with.

I am currently the Frontend Team Lead [@PureCars][purecars-org] while I like to focus primarily on Frontend technology I still like to work in Backend and Dev Ops areas. I also love watching Georgia Tech football and camping/hiking. Check out my [Github repos][craigmr-repos] and follow me on [twiiter][craigmr-twitter].
